I work as a DevOps Engineer but I have a passion for coding and technology.
With a strong background in both development and operations, I specialize in streamlining workflows, enhancing system reliability, and driving continuous integration and delivery practices.
My enthusiasm for coding extends beyond my professional role, as I constantly explore new programming languages and develop open-source projects.
