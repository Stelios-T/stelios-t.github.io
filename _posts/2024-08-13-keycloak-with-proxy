If you've ever worked as a System Administrator or DevOps Engineer in a large company, you're likely familiar with the occasional struggles related to certificates. Whether it's dealing with SSL/TLS certificates or managing trust stores, these issues can be a common source of headaches. I've faced these challenges too, and I’d like to share an experience that might help others in similar situations.

### The Scenario: A Tricky Certificate Issue

In my case, I was working on a project as an external partner for a large organization. The project involved maintaining a web application hosted on a server running Apache Tomcat. As is often the case in large enterprises, internet access on this server was restricted by a proxy server that monitored and controlled all outbound traffic. This setup added an extra layer of complexity to our task.

After deploying a few JAR files as part of a minor update, we encountered an unexpected issue. The web page became stuck in an endless refresh loop, and the server logs revealed the following error message:

```
sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: 
sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

This error indicated a clear problem: the server was using a self-signed certificate, and it wasn't recognized by the Java runtime environment on the server. In simpler terms, the Java application could not establish a trusted SSL connection because it couldn't validate the certificate provided by the server.

### The Common Solution: Keytool and the Java Truststore

Under normal circumstances, the solution to this problem is relatively straightforward. You would typically log into the server, use the `keytool` command to import the problematic certificate into the Java truststore (`cacerts` file), and then restart the server. The `keytool` utility is a powerful command-line tool that allows you to manage keys and certificates in the Java KeyStore (JKS).

However, in this case, the presence of a proxy server complicated things. Simply running the `keytool` command wasn’t enough because the utility needed to communicate with the remote server through the proxy to retrieve the certificate.

### The Solution: Using Keytool with a Proxy

To overcome this, you need to configure the `keytool` command to work with the proxy server. This involves adding proxy-related parameters to the command so that `keytool` can successfully retrieve the certificate through the proxy. Here’s the command you’ll need to use:

```bash
keytool -J-Dhttps.proxyHost=<proxy_hostname> -J-Dhttps.proxyPort=<proxy_port> -printcert -rfc -sslserver <remote_host_name:remote_ssl_port>
```

In this command:
- `<proxy_hostname>` is the hostname or IP address of your proxy server.
- `<proxy_port>` is the port number your proxy server listens on.
- `<remote_host_name:remote_ssl_port>` is the address and port of the remote server whose certificate you’re trying to retrieve.

This command retrieves the server’s certificate, even when your server’s internet access is restricted by a proxy.

### Saving the Certificate and Updating Java Truststore

Once you’ve successfully retrieved the certificate, it’s a good practice to save it to a `.crt` file. This allows you to keep a copy of the certificate for future reference or deployment on other servers. You can do this by redirecting the output of the `keytool` command to a file, like so:

```bash
keytool -J-Dhttps.proxyHost=<proxy_hostname> -J-Dhttps.proxyPort=<proxy_port> -printcert -rfc -sslserver <remote_host_name:remote_ssl_port> >> <your_certificate_name>.crt
```

With the certificate saved, the next step is to import it into your Java truststore (`cacerts`). Here’s a sample command to do that:

```bash
keytool -import -alias <certificate_alias> -file <your_certificate_name>.crt -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts
```

Be sure to replace `<certificate_alias>` with a meaningful alias for the certificate, and `<your_certificate_name>.crt` with the name of your certificate file. You’ll be prompted for the password to the `cacerts` file, which by default is `changeit`.

### Restarting the Server (Tomcat Case)

In my specific case, where everything was set up on a Tomcat server, I had to add the certificate to the server’s Java `cacerts` file and then restart Tomcat for the changes to take effect. Restarting Tomcat ensures that the server picks up the newly trusted certificate and establishes a secure connection without any issues.

### Conclusion

Managing certificates in environments with strict internet controls can be challenging, but with the right approach, it’s entirely manageable. By configuring `keytool` to work through a proxy, you can ensure that your Java applications can retrieve and trust the necessary certificates, even in restricted environments. This approach saved me significant time and effort, and I hope it helps you too!
